description: "Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich is a work of humorous fiction\
  \ by Stephen Leacock first published in 1914. It is the follow-up to his 1912 classic\
  \ Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town. Like that work, it is a sequence of interlocking\
  \ stories set in one town, but instead of focusing on a small Canadian town in the\
  \ countryside, it is set in a major American metropolis and its characters are the\
  \ upper crust of society.\nAlthough currently not as well known as the earlier book,\
  \ Arcadian Adventures was extremely popular in North America at the time of its\
  \ publication and for a while was considered the greater success. It was also translated\
  \ and published by the Bolshevik government soon after the 1917 revolution and it\
  \ became a bestseller in the Soviet Union.\nThe fourth story in the book features\
  \ a character that caricatures the religious leader 'Abdu'l-Bah√°, who visited Leacock's\
  \ resident city of Montreal in 1912.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
